# Combined Projects: Sales Prediction & OOP Tooling Enhancement

## Overview

This repository contains two distinct yet interconnected projects, demonstrating a comprehensive skill set in AI, data analysis, and object-oriented programming (OOP), catering to the multifaceted requirements of a BI/Data Analyst role.

- **Sales Prediction:** This project showcases my proficiency in AI and data analysis, focusing on predictive analytics without delving deeply into visualizations or time series forecasting to maintain project scope. Despite the project's focus on fundamental AI learning processes, it underscores my ability to quickly adapt and apply more complex analyses, including time series forecasting, as required.

- **OOP for Tooling Enhancement:** Addressing the need for sophisticated tool development, this project exemplifies my OOP programming capabilities, including working with APIs, handling JSON files, and implementing complex operations. It simulates a user engaging with meal recipes and tracks caloric intake, serving as a proof of concept for my experience in enhancing and transitioning to advanced, self-built tools.

### Sales Prediction

The goal here is to present a straightforward AI learning project encompassing basic exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, and model training. The documentation and comments within the Jupyter notebook offer comprehensive insights into the project's execution.

### OOP

Aligned with the job requirement to improve tooling, this segment demonstrates my OOP programming experience. The project involves API interaction, list comprehensions, and operations on JSON files to simulate meal consumption and caloric gain, showcasing core programming techniques.

#### Main Components

- **app.py:** The entry point of the project, prompting user interaction to determine meal consumption and caloric intake based on recipes from a JSON file and calculations through a public API.

- **Classes - Recipe and Health:** Defined to simulate eating behavior, these classes feature methods for calculating total calories from recipes using a public API and tracking caloric intake across sessions, highlighting the use of OOP principles for state management.

#### Reasons to Hire Me

This function humorously encapsulates the essence of the project, offering a unique insight into my qualifications and the project's value.

## Job Requirements Alignment

- **60% BI Support:** My projects, while primarily demonstrating predictive analytics, also lay the groundwork for advanced forecasting and customer behavior analysis capabilities, crucial for operational BI.

- **40% Tool Improvement:** The demonstrated experience with OOP concepts and potential for basic data warehousing aligns with the need for transitioning from Excel-based tooling to more sophisticated, self-built tools.

**Project Goal:** Predict the demand for the next 10 weeks using the provided data source.
